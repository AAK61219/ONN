# sim_setup

`sim_geometry.py`
- get positions of oscillators, their connections
- save data -> next time load it instead of computing again

`sim_physics.py`
- info about coupling between oscillators, e.g., cilia carpet model, Kuramoto model.
- functions to integrate dynamical equation


# Numerical simulations


Finding fixed points - `fixpoint`

Linear stability analysis - `linear`

Basins of attraction - `basin`



# Various

`slurm_submit.sh` - to submit SLURM jobs on a high-perfomance computer cluster.
