## `try04_1D_carpet_N=3.ipynb`
- 1D chain, N=3
- Fixpoint stability illustrated by quiver plot. Axes: 1st and 2nd cilium phase. (3rd cilium phase is deduced from Poincare plane equation)

## `try05_1D_carpet_find_fixpoint.ipynb`
- Develop a procedure to find fixpoints

## `try06_2D_find_fixpoint.ipynb`
- Find fixpoints for 6x6 triangular lattice.
- No classes yet.

## `try07_CARPET_optimize_friction.ipynb`
- Use `carpet` package
- Optimize & test friction computation
- Introduce classes procedure
- Recalculated fixpoints with `tol=10 ** -8`

## `try08b_CARPET_fixpoint_analysis.ipynb`
- Version b: use fixpoints from `try07` rather than `try06`

- Stability of fixpoints


## `try09_1D_carpet_analysis_N=6.ipynb` (and `try09` `a` `b` `c` )
FIXME: have to tranpose L_log_lin !
- Find fixpoints with `tol=10 ** -6`
- Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linearized Poincare map
- Visualize eigenvalues: points in dual lattice space; color - magnitude of eigenvalue.

- v2: fix L_log_lin: had to be transposed
  - Reuse fixpoints calculated before; recalculate eigenvector. Results have not visually changed
  - New way to calculate linear map (continued in `try13`): introduce a different set of perturbations with zero mean phase
  - Test non-linearity of Poincare map in vicinity of a fixpoint (continued in `try13`)


### b: N=30
FIXME: have to tranpose L_log_lin !
- Experimental: Consider a different x axis: 1/k
- extra precision fixpoitns (`tol = 10 **-8`)
- extra delta0s: compare eigenvalues
  Result:
  - error around `10 ** -4` - it's OK, but can't trust small values - big relative error
  - OK: sanity check - compare `abs` instead of only real part.
  - NOT OK: eigenvectors?
- Compare eigenvalues vs eigenvector length in dual lattice space.
- Eigenvectors decomposition to the basis of complex exponents of m-twists (<=> discrete fourier transform)
- Neutral perturbation is not the same as `dphidt` (?)
- Plot gij / gii (phi, phi+ delta) - does not look regular
### c: N=120

## `try_10_fixpoint_new_procedure.ipynb`
FIXME: have to tranpose L_log_lin !
- Search for a fixpoint in a form of m-twist, shifted in time.
- Unsuccessful

## `try12_1D_carpet_rotated.ipynb`
FIXME: have to tranpose L_log_lin !
- Rotated chain of cilia
- `a`, `b` `c` - different rotation angle
- Biggest eigenvalues plotted in dual lattice space
- Eigenvectors mapped to m-twists -> plot eigenvalues as a function of $k$
  - trigonometric dependence

## `try12v2_carpet_rotated_*.ipynb`
- FIXED: have to tranpose L_log_lin !

## `try11_carpet_analysis_nx=12_ny=12.ipynb`
- Redo `try08b` for a larger carpet with triangular lattice


## `try13_1D_chain_test_linearized_map.ipynb`
- Distance between fixpoint and its Poincare map image (1)
- Distance between fixpoints at different tolerance
- Ratio between (1) and ||Delta_1 - Delta_0||
- Compare trajectory tangent to neutral perturbation
- Change perturbation strength; find the best fit for the linear term; check inhomogenity.
- Check non-additivity
- Introduce new linearized Poincare map (single-node, mtwist perutrbations)
- Linearized map by fitting
- `L_log_lin` vs `L - I` eigenvalues
- Analyse noise in egenvectors vs eigenvalues magnitude
- Updated procedure to find fixpoints (mean phase = 0); not very good

### `try13b` N=30
- Debug new Poincare map
- Eigenvectors on circles
- Eigenvalues vs k
- Eigenvalues magnitude vs eigenvector decomposition residual
  (Analyse noise in egenvectors vs eigenvalues magnitude)
- MAXIMUM vs MEAN or MIN abs eigenvalue correlation
